It allows users to securely sign up, log in, log out, and manage their profiles, including updating personal details and viewing past contributions like reviews and footpath assessments. Users can explore and manage locations using an interactive map that displays markers for various locations, showing detailed information such as pollution levels, safety ratings, and tourist attraction status. The map also supports filters for customizing the view. Users can submit, update, and delete reviews for specific locations, with support for both text and voice input. Additionally, footpath assessments can be submitted through text feedback or image uploads, with AI-generated insights assisting in the process. Image uploads are analyzed using Google Vision API, extracting relevant metadata like labels, and these images can be managed (updated or deleted) by the users. AI integration enhances the platform by generating summaries and providing insights based on user reviews, assessments, and image analysis. For administrators, a dedicated dashboard offers visualizations such as charts and graphs, tracking trends like pollution and safety across locations, along with filters for analyzing data. The platformâ€™s user profile page allows for easy profile management, contribution tracking, and account deletion, ensuring a seamless user experience.\n\n\nif the user asks anything , take out info from this and provide him",
